            <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

            <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee
                specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
                In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
            </p>
            <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except
                for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

            </p>
            <p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</P>
            <ul>
                <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
                <li> 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
                <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
                <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>December 18, 1997</h3>
            <p>TML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
                <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
                <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>

            <header>Markup</header>
            <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and h1, although some
                represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

                <p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
                </p>

                <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>

        <section id="Semantics" class="main-section">
            <header>Semantics</header>
            <p>Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,[82] but has also included presentational markup, such as font,
                i and center tags. There are also the semantically neutral span and div tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational
                HTML markup with a view to the separation of presentation and content.[83]</p>
            <p>In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter and correlate previously unrelated, published facts
                for the benefit of human users.[84] Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0, mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's
                semantic agents lies in the fact that the current aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed in by web developers, who already know the web locations and the API semantics of the specific data they wish to mash, compare
                and combine.</p>

        <section id="Delivery" class="main-section">
            <header>Delivery</header>
            <p>HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email.</p>
            <p>The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. To
                allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document. This meta data usually includes the MIME type (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character
                encoding (see Character encoding in HTML).
            </p>
            <p>In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be well-formed XML; syntax errors may cause the browser to
                fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully, since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.</p>
